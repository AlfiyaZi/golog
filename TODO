* make separate types for Compound and Atom

* remove most methods from Term interface

* implement double quoted string syntax

* implement more ISO Prolog built-ins

* make Unify() a method on Term (since each term subtype knows
  some optimizations for unifying with itself)

* implement an efficient unification algorithm such as those
  described in "An Efficient Unification Algorithm" by Martelli,
  "A practically efficient and almost linear unification algorithm"
  by Escalada-Imaz, "A Practically Linear Unification Algorithm"
  by Baxter.

* implement indexing as described in https://gist.github.com/4642708

* support or-parallelism by creating a new ChoicePoint implementation
  which, in a separate goroutine, steps a machine until it fails or
  finds an answer.  It then sends itself down a channel where the original
  machine can extract its "future self" when its ready.  These goroutines
  could be spawned on a step() call based on predicate timing information
  collected while running.

* support and-parallelism with an implementation similar to or-parallelism
  but using a frame's conjunctions instead of their disjunctions

* steal good ideas from "Implementation of a high-speed Prolog interpreter"
  by Krall.  The abstract claims an interpreter that's as fast as
  compiled code.

* support attributed variables

* support tabling
